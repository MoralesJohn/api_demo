# api_demo
A basic intro to building an app in Swift, and includes UITableView with a custom cell, segue, notifications, URLSession, JSON decoding and handling of optionals. 

### Using the code
The demo is written in Swift 4.2 (5 is becoming available, but for now 4.2 is more documented and thus makes for an easier introduction). The best way to use it is not to use it at all. Start your own project, type everything in from scratch, and customize the hell out of it. I have only displayed a few basic pieces of info from each movie, but you can add to the decoding process, and reformat the displayed info as needed to learn how it all works. 

### The Storyboard
If need be, download my project to look at the storyboard if you are not sure how that works. Again though, you are better off building your own storyboard eventually. Storyboards are powerful, can be quite easy, can be _amazingly_ frustrating, and the only way to learn your way around them is to use them. A word of warning: keep them simple until you are comfortable with them. The first time you have to work out a commit conflict in a storyboard file is painful and intimidating process that only an XML lover could appreciate.

### What's not part of the project
There are lots of fun features and functionality available in swift and the Foundation library that I am not even touching on. The point of this demo is to illustrate some of the functions and patterns that swift coders deal with on a daily basis. Of course, there are coders out there building stand-alone games that have no need for an API call in the first place. I am not touching on CoreData, or any of the graphics, camera or map libraries, that many people will think are so elemental to daily code. For myself, having worked on a few projects now, these are the things that are just part of a day's work: optionals, tableViews including custom cells, segues, notifications, and API calls.

### Acknowledgements
Many thanks to Paul Hallett. In order to demo the URLSession and JSON decoding functions, this demo makes API calls to the SAWPI site, and we all need to appreciate the contribution such free API sites make to our work, hobbies and education. 

This project is created and shared for the benefit of all the people learning to code. It is great fun, and occasionally quite frustrating. In my own learning process, I have received help from many shared github repos and countless StackOverflow posts, and this is my way of contributing back some of that good karma.
